Social Exchange Theory
======================

In this chapter, we aims to establish a solid theoretical foundation for the study of online marketplaces. Here we draw heavily from sociology, the scientific study of society, especially the patterns of social interaction for our purpose. We first review three major paradigms of sociology, and introduce social exchange theory and the micro and macro distinction, which will become crucial in the next chapter when we review different measures of trust. Finally we review the limitations of social exchange theory, especially the rationality assumption.

Major Sociological Paradigms
----------------------------

A paradigm is a framework to formulate generalizations and theories based on shared assumptions. There are three major paradigms in sociology, structural functionalism, conflict theories, and symbolic interactionism {{"gerber2011sociology" | cite}. The first two paradigms are macro in terms of the level of analysis, and the last one micro. We will explain the macro and micro distinction later in the chapter. Each paradigm has its own set of assumptions and is best fit to answer different sets of questions as we show below.

-	Structural Functionalism (Macro)

Structure functionalism sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability. This paradigm has a macro-level orientation, which focuses on social structures that shape society as a whole and that society evolves like organisms. Important theorists in structural functionalism include Emile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and Niklas Luhmann (an important figure in trust literature that we review in the next chapter).

-	Conflict Theories (Macro)

One limitation of structural functionalism is that it views conflict as negative and cannot explain change very well. This is where conflict theory shines. Conflict theory views the society in a state of perpetual conflict due to competition for limited resources. The first theory was the class-conflict theory developed by Karl Max, but there are also other theories, such as the race-conflict theory, and gender-conflict theory.

-	Symbolic Interactionism (Micro)

The first two paradigms are inherently macro-level, focusing on society as a whole, while the third paradigm -- symbolic interactionism -- focuses on micro-level. Symbolic interactionism first appeared in Max Weber's work and takes a bottom-up approach. This approach views society in a constant state of re-creation through interaction and negotiation of meanings between individuals. In other words, social interactions between individuals create shared realities when people assign meanings to interactions. Finally, symbolic interactionism is especially important in social psychology, which the newer discipline of human-computer interaction draws heavily from.

Social Exchange Theory
----------------------

Social exchange theory is a framework that views social change and stability as a process of negotiated exchanges between different parties. Social exchange theory shares the assumptions with rational choice theory and structural functionalism.

Contemporary social exchange theory was first formulated by Richard M. Emerson by bridging two distinct views represented by George Homans and Peter Blau. In his 1976 paper *Social Exchange Theory* {{"emerson1976social" | cite}} on Annual Review of Sociology, Emerson analyzed and contrasted the psychological behavior focused approach to social exchange by Homans {{"homans1958social" | cite}} and the rational economic actor driven model by Blau {{"blau1964exchange" | cite}}. Emerson provided the middle ground and proposed to focus on social relations as units of analysis {{"emerson1976social" | cite}}. By doing so, Emerson considered social exchange theory "not a theory at all", but rather "a frame of reference within which many theories -- some micro and some more macro -- can speak to one another", which is very much in line of the embedded argument by that of Granovetter.

The Macro and Micro Distinction
-------------------------------

Limitations
-----------

1.	Rational Assumption Social exchange theory assumes rational decision. Later work in psychology showed that people are "predictable irrational in their decision making" {{"kahneman2011thinking" | cite}} and {{"ariely2008predictably" | cite}}.
