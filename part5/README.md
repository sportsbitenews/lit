E-Trust
=======

Since the very beginning of eCommerce, online reputation systems have always been a crucial feature of the ecosystem, while at the same time holding many tensions from parties with conflicts of interests.

Online reputation systems centralize reviews (numerical, textual, or even richer media including photos or videos) from past buyers or visitors, and hence provide more information to potential exchange partners.

When eCommerce sites eBay and Yahoo auction first emerged, it was considered a new phenomenon of trust between strangers. Resnick et al studied one of the earliest and best known Internet reputation systems by eBay, which provided insights including "well beyond reasonable expectation, it was almost always positive", and that "players reciprocate and retaliate" {{"resnick2002trust" | cite}}.

A decade later, people expanded the realm of exchange from physical goods to resources, such as transportation and lodging. The rapid growing peer economy marketplaces, most prominently, Uber and Airbnb, created even bigger doubts around trusting potential exchange partners. Almost all these platforms make extensive use of reputation systems to "solve" the trust problem. A most recent experiment using Airbnb users as participants showed that reputation systems can increase trust between dissimilar users, hence adjusting the bias created by homophily (people's natural tendency to like others who are similar) {{"abrahao2017reputation" | cite}}.

However, the extensive use of reputation systems also suffer from many problems that are hard to solve, including positive bias, and fake reviews. In a study conducted by Airbnb, non-reviewers were found to have worse experiences than reviews {{"fradkin2015bias" | cite}}. Perhaps it's simply hard to write negative reviews after you've spent the night at host's most intimate spaces -- their homes. Such selection bias in who writes online reviews created interesting phenomenon, summarized succinctly in the title of the paper "A first look at online reputation on Airbnb, where every stay is above average" {{"zervas2015first" | cite}}, where the authors found that nearly 95% of Airbnb properties boast an average user-generated rating of either 4.5 or 5 stars (the maximum).

In addition to positive bias, reputation systems are also vulnerable to fake reviews. There is an ongoing race between our ability to detect fake reviews, and better ways to generate fake reviews. Back in 2011, simple linguistic features (n-grams and LIWC {{"pennebaker2001linguistic" | cite}}) are sufficient to detect fake reviews generated by humans for hotels {{"ott2011finding, ott2012estimating"| cite}}. In 2017, with the lastest development in deep learning, AI can generate fake Yelp reviews that are "not only evade human detection, but also score high on "usefulness" metrics by users" {{"yao2017automated" | cite}}.

Despite the problems of reputation systems, they are still a crucial part of the online marketplace ecosystem, and research has looked into the effect of reputation systems on the dynamics of the ecosystem. Cook et al. compiled a book titled "eTrust: Forming Relationships in the Online World: Forming Relationships in the Online World", summarizing dozens of crucial work on the effect of reputation systems on the dynamics of online marketplaces {{"cheshire2009etrust" | cite}}. More interestingly, Kuwabara found in a 2015 study that reputation systems could in some cases undermine trust, and that "enforcing cooperation using contracts or tangible sanctions can backfire, undermining people's intrinsic motivation to cooperate" {{"kuwabara2015reputation" | cite}}.
