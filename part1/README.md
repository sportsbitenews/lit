Trust could be a decision in the use of "I trust you", as a verb. Trust could also be a noun that describes the state or the relationship, such as "trust in the society", or "interpersonal trust". This part of the document attempts to reconcile different definitions of trust and clarify a few related concepts. Finally, implications for HCI and data-driven approach to trust are discussed.

This literature review attempts to accomplish three things:

\(1\) summarize briefly some of the notable previous work on trust;

\(2\) clarify the relationship between trust and a few very closely related concepts, including psychological safety, familiarity, cooperation and collaboration, reciprocity, prosocial behavior, and altruism;

\(3\) provide a potential alternative information view of trust that have implications for HCI, i.e., designing for trust in computer-mediated environments.
