# Getting Started

## What is this?

You are reading Xiao's literature review hosted on [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/about). The goal is to streamline the experience of writing; to make giving and taking feedback from committee members (and frankly, everyone) easier; and to avoid the following scenario at all costs.

Gitbook is essentially powered by the version control system Git. I manage all the source files in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and each comment you make will be opened and tracked as an "issue" in a centralized dashboard for me.

You can choose different color themes (white, sepia, night) as well as fonts (serif, sans serif) when reading. You can see or hide the navigation bar. The entire website is also responsive so you can read on mobile phones or tablets.

Hopefully this will make writing dissertation a less lonely experience for me, and reading it a more fun experience for you.
