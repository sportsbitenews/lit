Getting Started
===============

What is this?
-------------

You are reading [Xiao Ma](http://maxiao.info/about)'s literature review for A-exam hosted on [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/about).

### If you are my committee member

We want to avoid the following scenario:

I hope this setup can make it easier for you to give feedback and for me to incorporate it. Gitbook is powered by the [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) Git. I manage all my writings as source files in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format and every change is backed up throughout the history of this document.

You can add comments to any part of the document, which will be opened as an "issue" and show up in a centralized dashboard. I can easily track all the "issues", have a discussion within that thread with you, and "close" an issue when we resolve it.

You can also choose different color themes (white, sepia, night) as well as fonts (serif, sans serif) when reading. You can hide or make show the navigation bar. The entire website is responsive so you can read on mobile phones or tablets.

Tentative Plan
--------------

My dissertation will focus on large scale social exchange systems. To begin with, I draw from sociology on social exchange theory, and the idea that trust is the infrastructure of social exchange. Then I will focus on the role of social networks and online marketplaces in changing the dynamics of social exchange, and modern computational methods to study these large scale systems. In addition, I explore various of aspects of social exchange systems such as identity and medium. Finally, I will develop and prototype image processing algorithms to increase the trustworthiness of online marketplaces.
