Social Exchange Theory
======================

Contemporary social exchange theory was first formulated by Richard M. Emerson by bridging two distinct views represented by George Homans and Peter Blau. In his 1976 paper *Social Exchange Theory* {{"emerson1976social" | cite}} on Annual Review of Sociology, Emerson analyzed and contrasted the psychological behavior focused approach to social exchange by Homans {{"homans1958social" | cite}} and the rational economic actor driven model by Blau {{"blau1964exchange" | cite}}. Emerson provided the middle ground and proposed to focus on social relations as units of analysis {{"emerson1976social" | cite}}. By doing so, Emerson considered social exchange theory "not a theory at all", but rather "a frame of reference within which many theories -- some micro and some more macro -- can speak to one another", which is very much in line of the embedded argument by that of Granovetter.
