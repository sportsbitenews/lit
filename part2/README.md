# Placemaking

In this chapter, I'll review the work by Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, and Oscar Newman to unpack how space can influence the social life of street.

Greenwich Village is an incredibly lively neighborhood in New York City. On a quite afternoon, one could find great pleasure in strolling the cobblestone streets lined with trees, quaint brownstones, and boutique shops with interesting window displays. After picking up a cupcake and/or a banana pudding at the Magnolia Bakery, head to the Washington Square Park, sit on a bench, and enjoy people watching till the sun sets. If you happen to be a music fan, Blue Note Jazz Club or (Le) Poisson Rouge may just be putting on a show that you would enjoy.

The liveliness of street life is not by chance but through design that caters to people. In the 1960s, Jane Jacobs and William H. Whyte did ground-breaking work in "placemaking" -- cities should be designed with the social interactions of people taken into consideration, not just cars. Jacobs formulated the concept "natural surveillance", or commonly known as the "eyes on the street" {{"jacobs1961death" | cite}} that lead to the defensible space theory by Oscar Newman {{"newman1972defensible" | cite}}. Whyte did extensive research on the social life of streets and articulated elements that are important to the use of public spaces, such as seating and shades {{"whyte1988city" | cite}}.
