# **Trust enables massive scale offline collaboration**

## The Network View of Collaboration

Web 2.0 has greatly facilitated online collaboration on a massive scale, e.g. Wikipedia, Github, Quora, various online forums, etc. Because information is not distributed equally among the nodes, and the need for information at each node constantly changes, exchanging information among nodes can greatly make the whole network more efficient and better configured.

The very foundation of such exchange on massive scale is the trust protocols in computer network communication. Because the nodes can trust the other nodes when exchanging a packet and not being attacked or resulting a breach in information that the node did not intend to share, participation is perceived as secure \(the peer-to-peer model\).

Information is unique because of the zero cost it has when copying thus it reduces the risk of exchange, and that it has very low cost of transporting with communication technology \(close to real time, not limited to distance\). This may be the reason that it's the first resource that achieved massive scale exchange.

But information is not the only resource the participants have and need. As humans, and members of the society, we have a lot of physical resources such as houses, cars, furniture, household items, books, collections, prints, fine arts, etc. We also have resources that are hard to share or exchange online, such as specific skills, or expertise \(e.g. surgery, disfusing a bomb, cat care, etc.\)

The configuration of such offline resources are often not optimal and prone to change. People have different resources configurations, and have needs for resources. The degree of match between the resources you own and the resources you need is correlated to well being. And because we live in a world of constant change, people can benefit from pooling, sharing, exchanging their offline resources, on massive scale to achieve optimal match of need of resources and access to resources.

## Difficulties in Offline Collaboration

However, the pooling, sharing or exchanging offline resources in a community face three inherent difficulties: \(a\) lack of liquidity, \(b\) information friction, and \(c\) risk of being ripped off.

Sometimes the goods are not of equal value, or not available at the correct time \(lack of liquidity\). The issue of liquidity has been addressed by the invention of currency. From shells to precious metal to paper bills to bitcoin, currency provides the liquidity for people to conduct exchange and reduces the friction costs at certain degree.

But currency cannot solve the problem of information friction.  Friction refers to the time and energy you need to invest in finding and coordinating other party or parties to exchange with. And lastly, there is the risk of being ripped off and being taken advantage of when conducting an exchange, \(e.g. the seller promises to deliver certain goods and disappear after receiving the payment.\)

The emergence of companies and organizations provided solution to these two problem. With a client-server model, company operates as the hub of information and they invest money in marketing and advertising to reduce the cost of information friction. In addition, companies build brand names and provide warranty that establish trustworthiness from customers. Companies, as a legal entity, is also regulated to meet certain criteria that further alleviate trust.

Financial institutions, as the one type of the companies, distribute value or liquidity throughout the network. The very foundation of the operating of such financial institutions is the customer's faith in the institution.

## Opportunities to Move to Peer-to-Peer Model

The only problem now with the client-server model of companies as the hub of exchange is that it is not the most efficient computationally. As we discussed before, each node's need for resources are constantly changing, and there is a lot of idling capacity in each node that are not being utilized. This gives rise to rental and second-hand good markets, which addresses the idling capacity problem to some degree.

But because of the friction cost of the transaction, the time granularity of utilizing such idling capacity is limited to years, or months. 

This internet \(Web 2.0\) and computation have almost solved this problem. With people being able to list resources they have and computationally we can find matches that are fit to exchange at close to real time. The last bit of the barrier lies in establishing trust among the participants.

## Understanding Trust Online

This is less understood. Because human impression is fuzzy.

is usually more costly or risky as it has people's physical safety on the line, and involving high value assets. A high level of trust is required for this kind of offline transactions to take place.

Web 1.0 helped distributing information. And Web 2.0 really made it an information exchange network.

Logistics industry is the equivalent of Web 1.0.
