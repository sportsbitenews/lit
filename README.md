# Getting Started

## What is this?

You are reading [Xiao Ma](http://maxiao.info/about)'s literature review for A-exam hosted on [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/about). The goal is to make the experience of dissertation writing not suck.

### If you are my committee member

We want to avoid the following scenario at all cost:

I hope this setup can make it easier for you to give feedback and for me implementing the changes. Gitbook is powered by the [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) Git. I manage all my writings as source files in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format and every change is backed up through the history of this document.

You can add comments to any part of the document, which will be opened as an "issue" and show up in a centralized dashboard. I can easily track all the "issues", have a discussion within that thread with you, and "close" an issue when we resolve it.

### If you are a curious reader

You can choose different color themes (white, sepia, night) as well as fonts (serif, sans serif) and sizes when reading. You can hide or make show the navigation bar. The entire website is responsive so you can read on mobile phones or tablets.

I am only beginning to put this document together so a lot of the times things will not make sense yet. But do feel free to drop me an email to chat up about research.

### If you are a fellow PhD student

I am wondering if you also find writing dissertation a daunting and lonely experience. I want to turn it to a more transparent process, where I get to show people how the sausage is made, how we go through the process of having no idea what to write about, to slowly formulating crappy drafts, to having a complete well-thought out two-hundred page thing that took five six years of our life.


## The Plan

This literature review will survey the following concepts: trust in sociology, related concepts to trust such as psychological safety and collaboration, implications for HCI, architecture and behavior in urban public places, and how everything ties into virtual reality as a new medium.
