# Getting Started

## What is this?

You are reading [Xiao Ma](http://maxiao.info/about)'s literature review for A-exam hosted on [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/about). The goal is to make the process of dissertation writing more social and transparent. I also believe some of the topics covered here are very relevant to the rapid evolving scene of sharing economy and virtual reality. I want to share these ideas in a timely manner so that they can inform the research and design of these areas in the real world. I will be cross-posting bits from this writing to <a href="https://medium.com/@infoxiao">Medium</a> when relevant.

### If you are my committee member

We want to avoid the following scenario:

I hope this setup can make it easier for you to give feedback and for me to incorporate it. Gitbook is powered by the [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) Git. I manage all my writings as source files in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format and every change is backed up throughout the history of this document.

You can add comments to any part of the document, which will be opened as an "issue" and show up in a centralized dashboard. I can easily track all the "issues", have a discussion within that thread with you, and "close" an issue when we resolve it.

You can also choose different color themes (white, sepia, night) as well as fonts (serif, sans serif) when reading. You can hide or make show the navigation bar. The entire website is responsive so you can read on mobile phones or tablets.

### If you are a fellow PhD student

I am wondering if you also find dissertation writing a daunting and lonely experience. I want to turn it to a more transparent and social process, where I get to show people "how the sausage is made" -- how we go through the process of having no idea what to write about, to slowly formulating crappy drafts, to finally articulating our thoughts and producing this two-hundred page thing that distills five or six years of intellectual journey.

I am only beginning to put this document together so a lot of the times things will not make sense yet. But do feel free to drop me an email to chat up about research. My work focuses on socio-technological systems that support collaboration and exchange. The key factors I look at are trust, anonymity, and beginning to experiment with virtual reality as a new medium.


## The Plan

This literature review will survey the following concepts: trust in sociology, related concepts to trust such as psychological safety and collaboration, implications for HCI, architecture and behavior in urban public places, and how everything may have the potential to be applied to the understanding and design of the future of social VR.
