# William H. Whyte

[William H. Whyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Whyte) (1917-1999) was an American urbanist, organizational analyst, journalist and people-watcher. He is most famous for the bestselling book *The Organization Man (1956)* on corporate culture, and the study of human behavior in urban public places.

Here we focus on reviewing two books by Whyte on human behavior in urban public places: *The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces (1980)* {{"whyte1980social" | cite}} and *City: Rediscovering the Center (1988)* {{"whyte1988city" | cite}}. Small portions in the second book appeared previously in the first one.

I want to highlight two core contributions by Whyte: (1) data-driven approach; and (2) design guidelines as output. I expand on each of the contribution below.

## Data-Driven Approach

Whyte used time-lapse cameras and diagrams extensively for data collection. Below is the back cover of the book *The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces*, showing Whyte holding and looking into a camera, presumably in the middle of observing people in public places.

When studying the use of plazas, Whyte set up cameras at the Segram's (see below), and recorded where people actually sit on the ledge, from dawn to dusk. Then based on data recorded by film, he summarized the data in a beautiful and succinct chart.

> From a rooftop across the street we focused two time-lapse cameras on the ledge and at 10-second intervals recorded what went on from early morning to dusk. I used the film to construct a chronological chart, which looks like rather like a player piano roll. Each line represents a sitter; the length of the line, the time he spent sitting; the channel that the line is in denotes on which of 11 squares he sat. Each square is four feet eight inches wide; the total ledge, 51 feet. The continuous line at the bottom of the chart shows the total number of sitters at any one time.

A combination of camera and charts is a simple yet powerful approach to add evidence to the debate around zoning -- how the public space should be designed. In 1961 New York embarked on [a new incentive zoning](http://www.nypap.org/preservation-history/1961-new-york-city-zoning-resolution/), that gave commercial developers bonus floor-area in exchange for the provision of public plazas. The incentive zoning took off, but no one really knows if the public plazas are being used by the public at all. The data-driven approach provided first-hand evidence that some of the plazas were not being used. In Whyte's own words:

> But how well were the new spaces working out? There had been no mechanism for monitoring the program. In all that larger staff, there was no one person who had the job of going out and checking up on the results. In a draft of the plan, I floated a proposal for setting up an evaluative unit. It got nowhere.
> 
> This was one of the reasons I set up the Street Life Project. As I recount elsewhere, I thought that observation of how people used city spaces would be useful for such specific matters as plazas and arcades. What I most hoped to demonstrate was the general applicability of the approach and the simplicity of the techniques involved.
> 
> It was obvious that a lot of the places were awful: sterile, empty spaces not used for much of anything except walking across. But a few were excellent. When I showed the planners time-lapsed films of nothing happening on some plazas, lots on others, they agreed that further case-and-effect study was in order. Planning commission chairman Donald Elliott thought it could help frame new zoning standards.... [p.234] {{"whyte1988city" | cite}}

## Design Guidelines as Output

The data-driven approach resulted not only in interesting observations, but also practical guidelines incorporated into zoning law in 1975. Whyte provided valuable visual and audio recordings of social interactions in New York City. The book *The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces* is accompanied with a [documentary film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1778327/) of the same name that is fun to watch.

But more than interesting observations, Whyte's research, together with later research (e.g. Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience {{"kayden2000privately" | cite}}), influenced [zoning standards](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/pops/pops-plaza-standards.page) to shape public spaces that are high quality and accessible.

Below is an example of the type of guidelines that resulted from Whyte's empirical data, which was approved by Board of Estimate in May 1975 as an amendment, specifying the minimum amount of seating for plazas.

> **1975 Zoning Amendments**
> 
> Seating
> 
> There shall be a minimum of 1 linear foot of seating for each 30 square feet of urban plaza area, except that for urban plazas fronting upon a street having a grade change of at least 2.25 feet in 100 feet or for through-block urban plazas, there shall be minimum of 1 linear foot of seating for each 40 square feet of urban plaza area.
> 
> Seating shall have a minimum depth of 16 inches. Seating with backs at least 12 inches high shall have a minimum depth of 14 inches. Seating 30 inches or more in depth shall count double provided there is access to both sides.
> [Appendix A] {{"whyte1988city" | cite}}


Today, every time I hang out at Bryant park, drinking coffee, attending a public movie screening night in the summer, or just watching people, I always remember something that Whyte commented on -- the seating, the sun, the talking between people, the adjacency of the park to street level, etc. Such is the essence of placemaking, creating public spaces that promote people's health, happiness, and well being.
