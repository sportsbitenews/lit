Social Exchange Theory
======================

In this chapter, we aims to establish a solid theoretical foundation for the study of online marketplaces. Here we draw heavily from sociology, the scientific study of society, especially the patterns of social interaction for our purpose. We first review three major paradigms of sociology, and introduce social exchange theory and the micro and macro distinction, which will become crucial in the next chapter when we review different measures of trust. Finally we review the limitations of social exchange theory, especially the rationality assumption.

Major Sociological Paradigms
----------------------------

A paradigm is a framework to formulate generalizations and theories based on shared assumptions. There are three major paradigms in sociology, structural functionalism, conflict theories, and symbolic interactionism {{"gerber2011sociology" | cite}. The first two paradigms are macro in terms of the level of analysis, and the last one micro. We will explain the macro and micro distinction later in the chapter. Each paradigm has its own set of assumptions and is best fit to answer different sets of questions as we show below.

-	Structural Functionalism (Macro)

Structure functionalism sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability. This paradigm has a macro-level orientation, which focuses on social structures that shape society as a whole and that society evolves like organisms. Important theorists in structural functionalism include Emile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and Niklas Luhmann (an important figure in trust literature that we review in the next chapter).

-	Conflict Theories (Macro)

One limitation of structural functionalism is that it views conflict as negative and cannot explain change very well. This is where conflict theory shines. Conflict theory views the society in a state of perpetual conflict due to competition for limited resources. The first theory was the class-conflict theory developed by Karl Max, but there are also other theories, such as the race-conflict theory, and gender-conflict theory.

-	Symbolic Interactionism (Micro)

The first two paradigms are inherently macro-level, focusing on society as a whole, while the third paradigm -- symbolic interactionism -- focuses on micro-level. Symbolic interactionism first appeared in Max Weber's work and takes a bottom-up approach. This approach views society in a constant state of re-creation through interaction and negotiation of meanings between individuals. In other words, social interactions between individuals create shared realities when people assign meanings to interactions. Finally, symbolic interactionism is especially important in social psychology, which the newer discipline of human-computer interaction draws heavily from.

Social Exchange Theory
----------------------

Social exchange theory is a framework that views social change and stability as a process of negotiated exchanges between different parties. Social exchange theory shares the assumptions with rational choice theory and structural functionalism.

Social exchange theory started developing with George Homans's work "Social Behavior as Exchange" {{"homans1958social" | cite}}, and further developed by Peter Blau {"blau1964exchange" | cite}} and Richard Emerson {{"emerson1976social" | cite}}. Homans's work emphasized individual behavior of actors in dyadic exchange. Blau's work on the other hand, focused on the economic and utilitarian perspective.

Emerson brought two perspectives together. In his 1976 paper *Social Exchange Theory* {{"emerson1976social" | cite}}, Emerson analyzed and contrasted the psychological behavior focused approach to social exchange by Homans and the rational economic actor driven model by Blau. Emerson focuses primarily on exchange relations, which are the "building blocks for more complex social structures called exchange networks or corporate groups (involving intragroup exchanges)." An actor can be a person, a corporate group (or collective actor), or a role-occupant {{"cook1992two" | cite}}.

The Macro and Micro Distinction
-------------------------------

Different paradigms will be shown to be useful for different questions of online marketplaces as we will show in later chapter. For example, conflict theories are especially suitable for explaining biases in online marketplace (with regard to status, gender, and race).

However there is an important gap between the paradigms that we need to bridge, namely, the macro and micro distinction of these paradigms. In 1992, Karen Cook and Joseph M. Whitmeyer published the paper, "Two Approaches to Social Structure: Exchange Theory and Network Analysis", which pointed out that "much convergence exists between exchange theory and network approaches to social structure." However, as we will show in the next chapter, the literature on trust is very divided in the macro and micro treatment to social structure. Just as Granovetter pointed out that the most approapriate approach to study economic action is through the embedded model, neither over- or under-socialized {{"granovetter1985economic" | cite}}, I argue the study of trust and online marketplaces should also follow the same embedded model, taking into considerations of network structure while using dyadic level empirical data for hypothesis testing (see the latest example of work on Facebook buy and sell groups {{"holtz2017social" | cite}}).

Limitations
-----------

We will show in the next chapters how social exchange theory is useful for organizing trust literature. However, social exchange theory does have several limitations.

-	Rational assumption

Social exchange theory assumes rational decision. Later work in psychology showed that people are predictably irrational in their decision making {{"kahneman2011thinking" | cite}} and {{"ariely2008predictably" | cite}}. My hypothesis is that such irrational decision making also exists in trust decisions and online marketplaces yet so far the studies on online marketplaces have all assumed rationality.

-	Macro focus

Social exchange theory has a macro focus that does not really merge with the network analysis methods. Bridging the macro and micro gap will be one contribution that my work aims to do.
